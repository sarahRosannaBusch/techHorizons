      <h1>
        Welcome to Tech Horizons!
      </h1>
      <p>
        For our Computer and Electronics Engineering Technology capstone project at
        Camosun College, we have created three Internet of Things devices that will
        improve your life and those of your pets.
      </p><br>
      <div class='threeCols'>
        <img class='device' src='images/tracker.jpg' />
        <p>
          The first is a pet tracking device that attaches to the collar of your cat or
          dog. It uses the 3G network to connect to the Internet, uploading the GPS location
          of your pet periodically to the cloud, where you can access it if he gets lost.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='threeCols'>
        <img class='device' src='images/feeder.jpg' />
        <p>
          The second device is a bird food dispenser for cages that have
          half inch bar spacing. It holds approximately 20 tsp of seed that can be
          dispensed with a click of a button from your phone or laptop, for those days when
          you can't make it home in time for your pet's dinner.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='threeCols'>
        <img class='device' src='images/lamp.jpg' />
        <p>
          The third device is a lamp that is aimed at improving our circadian rhythms,
          and therefore our quality of sleep. It accomplishes this by turning from
          the bright light that we need during the day, to a warm redder light in the
          evening allowing our bodies to produce melatonin, triggering proper sleep.
        </p>

          As a creative person I have been enjoying learning to design visually appealing,
          easy to navigate webpages. I am using these skills to create the functionality
          and controls for our products as lead programmer.

          As a homeschooler I have always been interested in the inner workings of
          electronic devices. I am using this knowledge to create the circuits for
          our products.
