      <h1>
        Welcome to Tech Horizons!
      </h1>
      <p>
        For our Computer and Electronics Engineering Technology capstone project at
        Camosun College, we are creating three IoT devices that will improve your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is a pet tracking device that attaches to the collar of your cat or
        dog. It uses the 3G network to connect to the Internet, storing the GPS location
        of your pet periodically to the cloud, where you can access it if he gets lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second device is a food dispenser for small animals in cages that have
        half inch bar spacing. We are designing it specifically with budgies in mind,
        so it will hold approximately 16tsp of seed that can be dispensed on an automated
        schedule, or manually from your smart phone or laptop, for those days when
        you can't make it home in time for your pet's dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third device is a lamp that is aimed at improving our circadian rhythms,
        and therefore our quality of sleep. It will accomplish this by turning from
        the bright light that we need during the day, to a warm redder light in the
        evening allowing our bodies to produce melatonin, triggering proper sleep.
      </p>
